## Introduction

JTAG, or Joint Test Action Group, is a standard for verifying designs and testing integrated circuits. The IEEE 1149.1 standard outlines the JTAG interface, which allows for boundary-scan testing. This repository focuses on a straightforward implementation of this standard using Verilog, making it easier for engineers and developers to integrate JTAG capabilities into their projects.

You can download the latest version of the code and documentation from the [Releases section](https://github.com/saadelahii/JTAG-IEEE-1149.1/releases). 

## Features

- Basic JTAG functionality implemented in Verilog
- Integration with a Circuit Under Test (CUT)
- Testbench support for easy verification
- Compatible with popular tools like ModelSim and Quartus
- Supports TCL scripting for automation
- Reliability-focused design for robust testing

## Getting Started

To get started with the JTAG-IEEE-1149.1 implementation, you will need the following tools:

- **Verilog Simulator**: Use ModelSim or any compatible simulator for testing.
- **FPGA Development Environment**: Quartus is recommended for synthesis and programming.
- **TCL Scripting Tool**: For automating test sequences.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. Installed ModelSim or a similar simulator.
2. Installed Quartus or another FPGA tool.
3. Basic knowledge of Verilog and digital design principles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadelahii/JTAG-IEEE-1149.1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd JTAG-IEEE-1149.1
   ```

3. Open the project in your chosen development environment (ModelSim or Quartus).

4. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the environment.

## Usage

To use the JTAG implementation:

1. Load the Verilog files into your simulator or synthesis tool.
2. Compile the design.
3. Create a testbench to verify the functionality.
4. Use the JTAG interface to communicate with the CUT.

### Example Testbench

Here is a simple example of how to set up a testbench for the JTAG implementation:

```verilog
module testbench;
  reg TCK, TMS, TDI;
  wire TDO;

  // Instantiate the JTAG module
  jtag jtag_inst (
      .TCK(TCK),
      .TMS(TMS),
      .TDI(TDI),
      .TDO(TDO)
  );

  initial begin
      // Initialize signals
      TCK = 0;
      TMS = 0;
      TDI = 0;

      // Apply test vectors
      // ...
  end
endmodule
```
